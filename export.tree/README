These data serve as testing dataset for the paper:

	Bontempi, D., Benini, S., Signoroni, A., Svanera, M., & Muckli, L. (2019). 
	CEREBRuM: a Convolutional Encoder-decodeR for Fully Volumetric Fast sEgmentation of BRain MRI. 
	arXiv preprint arXiv:1909.05085.

For every subject, two folders are provided, containing:

anat/
* the anatomical (defaced)

derivatives/
* two segmentations A and B (segmentations/), with FreeSurfer and Cerebrum segmentations respectively
* with the slices used for the behavioural (slices/)
